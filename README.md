# Design patterns (Go)
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## The Catalog of Design Patterns
- Creational patterns
    These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns
    These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns
    These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
