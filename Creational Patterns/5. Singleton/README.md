# Singleton 
singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## How to Implement
1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.
2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.
3. Implement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.
4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.
5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.

## Relations with Other Patterns
1. A Facade class can often be transformed into a Singleton since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.
2. Flyweight would resemble Singleton if you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental differences between these patterns:
    - There should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a Flyweight class can have multiple instances with different intrinsic states.
    - The Singleton object can be mutable. Flyweight objects are immutable.
3. Abstract Factories, Builders and Prototypes can all be implemented as Singletons.
